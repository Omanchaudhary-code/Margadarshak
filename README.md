# Margadarshak â€“ Graduation Probability Predictor

**Margadarshak** is a web-based application developed to help students assess their probability of graduating based on academic performance and personal circumstances. It utilizes Monte Carlo simulation to generate a probabilistic forecast and offers personalized insights and suggestions to support informed academic decision-making.

## Features

- Graduation probability estimation based on multiple variables, including GPA trends, study habits, and support systems.
- Monte Carlo simulation to model uncertainty and simulate thousands of academic outcomes.
- Personalized recommendations to guide students in improving academic performance.
- User-friendly web interface with real-time result generation.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Django, FastAPI
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Simulation Engine**: Node.js (Monte Carlo method implementation)

## System Overview

1. **Data Input**: Students provide academic and personal data such as GPA, study hours, social engagement, and well-being indicators.
2. **Simulation Process**: The Monte Carlo model generates a range of possible outcomes by running thousands of randomized scenarios.
3. **Prediction Output**: The system calculates a probability score indicating the likelihood of graduation.
4. **Personalized Feedback**: Students receive recommendations tailored to their input data, helping them understand the areas requiring improvement.

## Testing and Validation

- **Internal Testing**: Conducted using synthetic data to evaluate the performance and reliability of the simulation model.
- **User Testing**: Pilot testing with a sample of students to assess usability and effectiveness.
- **Validation**: Model parameters refined based on statistical comparison with academic records and user feedback.

## Project Timeline

| Phase                                 | Duration       |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| Literature Review and Data Collection | 3 weeks        |
| Model Design                          | 4 weeks        |
| Development (Frontend & Backend)      | 6 weeks        |
| Testing and Validation                | 2 weeks        |
| Final Adjustments and Report Writing  | 1 week         |
| **Total Duration**                    | **16 weeks**   |

## Budget Estimate

| Item                        | Cost (NPR) |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Domain and Hosting          | 3,500      |
| Miscellaneous Expenses      | 1,500      |
| **Total**                   | **5,000**  |

## Limitations

- The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and reliability of the input data.
- As the data is self-reported, it may contain biases or inconsistencies.
- The simulation provides probabilistic estimates, not definitive outcomes, and results must be interpreted accordingly.

## Expected Outcomes

The expected outcome is a functional and accessible platform that allows students to:
- View an estimated probability of graduating.
- Identify key factors influencing their academic outcomes.
- Receive tailored suggestions to improve academic performance.
- Develop greater awareness of academic and mental health challenges.

Additionally, the platform may provide aggregate insights useful to educators and policymakers.
